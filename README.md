This Arduino project implements an interactive 8x8 LED matrix game inspired by Minesweeper. The game uses an Arduino Mega (Atmega328 Chip) to control the LED matrix, 
allowing players to navigate a crosshair using directional buttons and mark positions where they believe mines are hidden.
The difficulty can be adjusted, affecting the number of mines and display time. The code includes functions for scrolling text messages, displaying patterns, 
and managing game logic. Players must remember the briefly shown mine positions and mark them correctly to win. 
The project demonstrates skills in low-level hardware manipulation, game design, and embedded systems programming.
